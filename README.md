# Data-Visualization-by-Python
We need data visualization because a visual summary of information makes it easier to identify patterns and trends than looking through thousands of rows on a spreadsheet. It's the way the human brain works.Charts and graphs make communicating data findings easier even if you can identify the patterns without them.
